"This is my change to README.md after the initial commit."

"And THIS is my change to README.md after deleting the sentence 'This is some text.'"

"Finally, this is my third update to README.md. Note that if I write "git checkout -- README.md", it will undo this change if I didn't commit it yet."

'Fourth update. Note that since this is already in the git repository, I don't need to add it before committing it; I just need to write git commit -am "my message" instead of git commit -m "my message".'

"Fifth update: the technique mentioned in Update 4 does not work for untracked new files, only tracked new files and ones currently in the repository."

"Update 6: make sure to include a message after -am or -m, or it screws everything up."
